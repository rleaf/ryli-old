            This project was my entry to SPD's student design competition. It consists of a four page spread. I decided to go with a spread layout that had a science fiction and computer-esque aesthetic.
            "What is Artificial Intelligence?" was the headline and I focused on illustrating "bundles" of threads together to resemble the connectionism that occurs in neural networks.
